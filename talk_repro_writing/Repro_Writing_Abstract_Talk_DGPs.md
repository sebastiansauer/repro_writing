Reproducible Paper Writing
=====

Scientific publications should both announce a result and convince 
readers that the result is correct (Mesirov, 2010). 
However, in psychology, studies that replicate (or fail to replicate) 
others' findings are almost impossible to publish in top scientific journals 
(Crocker & Cooper, 2011) thus contributing to the so-called "reproducibility crisis" in psychological sciences 
(Open Science Collaboration, 2015). This is not only due to the fact that researchers value new results 
 higher than reproducing existing ones, but also by a lack of 
 technical and statistical skills (Peng, 2015). Thus better technical skills 
 for reproducible paper writing and data analyses may provide a remedy 
 to the reproducibility crisis. In this talk, we present a method that 
is well-suited for writing reproducible academic papers. This method 
is a combination of Latex, R, Knitr, Git, and Pandoc. These software 
tools are robust, well established and not more than reasonable complex. 
Two other approaches, one based on Word Processors (MS Word), and one 
based on Markdown, are discussed and ultimately disencouraged. 
The presentation is based on a practical software demonstration. 
A Github repository is provided for easy reproducibility.
