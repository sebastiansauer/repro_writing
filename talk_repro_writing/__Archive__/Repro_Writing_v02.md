Reproducible Paper Writing
=====


A research paper can be dubbed reproducible if and only if data and code are available, 
and if the re-analyses by a non-author confirms the initial results [REF]
(http://biostatistics.oxfordjournals.org/content/10/3/405.full). Reproducibility, 
as opposed to replicability, is important because successfully replicating 
a study is not neccessarily guaranteed even if the study was well conducted. 
The current "reproducibility crisis" 
[REF](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2015.00827.x/abstract) 
is partly due to a lack of technical and statistical skills [REF]
(http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2015.00827.x/abstract). 
Thus better technical skills for reproducible paper writing and data analyses 
may provide a remedy. In this talk, we present a method that is well-suited 
for writing reproducible academic papers. This method is a combination of 
Latex, R, Knitr, Git, and Pandoc. These software tools are robust, well 
established and not more than reasonable complex. Two other approaches, 
one based on Word Processors (MS Word), and one based on Markdown, are 
discussed and ultimately disencouraged. The presentation is based on a 
practical software demonstration. A Github repository is provided for easy reproducibility.




Scientific publications should both announce a result and convince readers 
that the result is correct [REF](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3878063/).
However, in psychology, studies that replicate (or fail to replicate) others' 
findings are almost impossible to publish in top scientific journals 
[REF](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/334/6060/1182.full). 
This lead to the so-called "reproducibility crisis" in psychological sciences 
[REF](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716.full?keytype=ref&siteid=sci&ijkey=1xgFoCnpLswpk). 
This is not only due to the fact that researchers value new approaches higher 
than the reproducibility of old results, but also by a lack of technical and s
tatistical skills [REF](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2015.00827.x/abstract).
