Reproducible research and literate programming
===============================================


On programming, we should concentrate on explaining to humans, what we
want the computer to do -- instead on focusing on instructing a computer
[@Knuth1984]. This idea has not only gained widespread currency in 
software development communities, but harbors great benefit for science 
as well.
In particular, literate programming can be thought of as an necessary
condition for reproducible science. Reproducibility is an umbrella term
referring to the degree that independent researchers can confirm the 
conclusions of some piece of research [@Peng2015]. 
The current "reproducibility crisis"
[@OpenScienceCollaboration2015] is partly due to the fact that is often
hard or even impossible at all to reproduce the results of an (empirical)
research article. Thus, a more thorough orientation and appropriate 
methods are in high need to foster reproducible research. In this 
poster, we present a model of different layers of requirements of 
reproducible research. 
Next, we demonstrate a simple "recipe" for producing a reproducible 
research report based on literate programming. T
hat is, we explain the use of well-established tools for that purpose. 
Specifically, we show how to mix R code and text (and data) 
in one document using a *noweb* dialect called *knitr* 
[@xie2013dynamic].
