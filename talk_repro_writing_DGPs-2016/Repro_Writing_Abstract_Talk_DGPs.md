Reproducible Paper Writing
=====

Scientific publications should both announce a result and convince 
readers that the result is correct [@Mesirov2010]. Reproducibility 
refers to methods which help the reader to convince themselves by own means
that a given result is correct, or plausible	 at least. Thus, reproducibility,
as opposed to replicability, is particularly important because successfully 
replicating a study is not neccessarily possible even if the study 
was well conducted [@Peng2015]. In any case, a reanalysis of the 
data must result in similar or identical results.  
The current "reproducibility crisis" [@OpenScienceCollaboration2015]
is partly due to a lack of technical and statistical skills [@Peng2015]. 
Thus better technical skills for reproducible paper writing and data analyses 
may provide a remedy to the reproducibility crisis. 
In this talk, we present a method that 
is well-suited for writing reproducible academic papers. This method 
is a combination of Latex, R, Knitr, Git, and Pandoc. These software 
tools are robust, well established and not more than reasonable complex. 
 Additional approaches, such as using word processors (MS Word), Markdown, 
 or online collaborative writing tools (Authorea) are presented briefly. 
The presentation is based on a practical software demonstration. 
A Github repository for easy reproducibility is provided.
