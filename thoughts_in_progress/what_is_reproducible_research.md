What is "reproducible" research?
=========


1. data publicly/restrictedly available to other researchers
2. computer code, too
3. materials (such as information on stimuli and lab details), too
4. in essence, similar to "replication"?
5. Cornerstone of science is that you are able to "redo" any experiment/study
6. But "redo" can mean *two* things:
	7. Collect *new* data to replicate study --> **REPLICABILITY**
	8. Re-analysis study based on *existing* data/ code to see whether it was analyzed properly  --> **REPRODUCIBILITY**    
7. Researchers must be honest to report what they in reality/ effectively have done (or they must be forced to it?)
8. There should be nore "technical" barriers to reproduce study (e.g., analyses was performed with strange software, nobody is able to read/open its files)


**In short, repro. science amounts to providing a "cookbook" to your study. Anyone (with decent experience in your field) should come to the same results (or conclusions) as you, when going through each step of the study.**
