Why is reproducible research important?
========


[Roger D. Peng puts it this way:](http://simplystatistics.org/2014/06/06/the-real-reason-reproducible-research-is-important/)

<cite> "Then why is reproducibility so important? Reproducibility is important because it is the only thing that an investigator can guarantee about a study." </cite>

<cite>"Contrary to what most press releases would have you believe, an investigator cannot guarantee that the claims made in a study are correct (unless they are purely descriptive)."  </cite>


Reproducibility is so important, because we can control it - in contrast to replicability.
