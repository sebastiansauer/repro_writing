=======


(from an author's point of view)



1. Reference management must be included 
2. Ref. mgt should support (many) different citation styles 
3. must work well with distributed authors working in paralell
4. Version control
5. work across all plattforms (OS, text editing, reference mgt)
6. manuscript layout conforms to journal (or university) requirements
7. supports formula (preferable math jax/ Latex style)
8. learning curve not to steep
9. of course, technically stable
10. human readable files
11. free of charge?
12. Focus on content, not style, or technology (hey, I want to write a paper, not doing art or developing some technology!)
13. statistical results are automatically pasted into the manuscript
